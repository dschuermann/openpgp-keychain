<h2>Are my secret keys safe on my mobile device?</h2>
<p>This is a very common question, and it's not an easy one. In the end
it comes down to how much you trust your mobile device. The real
question usually isn't, "how safe are they", but rather "are they less
safe than on my laptop"? The answer depends on three factors:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Do you trust the hardware? Obviously, there are no guarantees that
        the vendor of your phone hardware didn't add some kind of
        backdoor. Then again, the same applies to your laptop's hardware,
        so it's about even.
    </li>
    <li>How easily can the device be stolen? This depends a lot on how
        careful you are, but this too is probably about even with your
        laptop.
    </li>
    <li>Do you trust the software? The Android operating system actually
        offers a lot more in the way of security between applications than
        desktop operating systems. No app without root privileges besides
        OpenKeychain can ever access the keys stored in OpenKeychain's
        database. By comparison, any program you run on your computer can
        just upload your gnupg keyring, if those files belong to the same
        user. As long as Android as a platform is trustworthy, your keys
        are safe from malware apps.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>In conclusion, we believe that secret keys are not notably less safe
on your mobile than they would be on your laptop. If your security
requirements are high enough that you don't keep your keys on your
laptop, you probably shouldn't put them on your mobile either.
Otherwise, they should be fine.</p>
<h2>What is the best way to transfer my own key to OpenKeychain?</h2>
<p>Ideally, put the key on an sd card, import, then erase from the sd
card. If your mobile does not have an sd card reader, read on.</p>
<p>Our recommended method is to transfer the exported key "through the
cloud", but with a super-safe passphrase which is only used during the
transfer. Your key is <strong>encrypted with its passphrase</strong>, the only
visible parts in the exported file are your public key.</p>
<p>So is this really safe? The answer is: Yes, IF you use a good
passphrase. If your passphrase is as difficult to guess as your key,
an attacker will gain no useful information from your exported key
file. To give you a (very!) rough impression, the passphrase
"J0hnnnyy1995" is about a third as difficult to guess as a 2048 bit
RSA key, while "%aBbaf11!o9$pP2,o9/=" is about the same.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Make up a long and complex passphrase to use during the transfer.
        It should be at least 20 characters (more is better, although more
        than 50 is overkill), with varying capitalization, many special
        characters and <em>no words from the dictionary</em>. Yes, it is annoying
        to type, but you'll only use it once! You can also write it down,
        but make sure to destroy the note afterwards, and make sure it is
        never transferred over the internet!
    </li>
    <li>Change the passphrase of your key to that one, then export</li>
    <li>Transfer the key file to your mobile by whatever way is most
        convenient to you (Mail to yourself, PushBullet, Dropbox, ...)
    </li>
    <li>Import the key with OpenKeychain, then delete the file from your
        storage.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Change the passphrase</strong> to an easier one which is still safe,
        but more reasonable to type.
    </li>
</ol>

<h2>Why is OpenKeychain's database not password protected?</h2>
<p>Your keys are already encrypted with their passphrase - that's the
reason you have to input it for every crypto operation. There is no
point in encrypting those keys again with another password, so
password protecting the entire database would only protect the list of
public keys. If this is important to you, consider using
<a href="https://source.android.com/devices/tech/security/encryption/">full disk encryption</a>.
</p>
<h2>Should I certify a key without manually comparing fingerprints?</h2>
<p>To certify someone's key, you should make sure that it's really that
same key the other person wants you to certify with their name on it.</p>
<p>Since keys are usually obtained from a keyserver, it is necessary to
double-check that the keyserver gave you the correct key. This is
traditionally done by manually comparing the key's entire fingerprint,
character by character.</p>
<p>However, scanning a QR code, receiving a key via NFC, or exchanging
keys via SafeSlinger all have that same check already built-in, so
as long as you trust the method used for key exchange, there is no
reason to check the fingerprint again manually.</p>
<h2>Can I mark public keys as trusted without certifying them with my own key?</h2>
<p>No. You can, however, simply create a new key just for certification,
which will essentially be the same thing.</p>
<h2>How can I specify connection port for Keyserver?</h2>
<p>Add a new Keyserver (or modify existing one) by going to Preferences -&gt; General -&gt;
Keyservers. Enter the port number after the Keyserver address and preceded it by a colon. For
example, "p80.pool.sks-keyservers.net:80" (without quotation marks) means that server
"p80.pool.sks-keyservers.net" is working on a port 80.
Default connection port is 11371 and it doesn't need to be specified.</p>
<h2>How to prepare a YubiKey NEO for OpenKeychain?</h2>

    <li><a href="http://www.yubico.com/2012/12/yubikey-neo-openpgp/">Prepare it for usage with
        OpenPGP using GnuPG and Yubico's tools</a>.
    </li>
    <li>Export the keypair from GnuPG with
        <code>
            gpg -a --output gpg-secret-key.asc --export-secret-keys &lt;insert key id or name&gt;
        </code>
        and transfer the file to your Android device.
    </li>
    <li>In OpenKeychain, select "Import from file", select the file and import the keypair. It will
        be automatically detect that this is a keypair that works with a YubiKey only.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>You can now use your YubiKey with OpenKeychain and compatible <a

hold your YubiKey against the NFC antenna.</p>

<h1>Known Issues</h1>

<h3>Importing secret key fails</h3>
<p>Before posting a new bug report, please check if you are using gpg prior to 2.1.0 and changed the
expiry date before exporting the secret key.</p>
<p>Changing the expiry date of a key in gpg prior to version 2.1.0 breaks the secret key in a way
which emerges only on export. It's not a problem with OpenKeychain, we correctly reject the key
because its self-certificates are either invalid, or have wrong flags.</p>
<p>This issue has been reported before (<a
        href="https://github.com/open-keychain/open-keychain/issues/996">#996</a>, <a
        href="https://github.com/open-keychain/open-keychain/issues/1003">#1003</a>, <a
        href="https://github.com/open-keychain/open-keychain/issues/1026">#1026</a>), and can be
assumed to affect a large number of users. The bug in gpg has been fixed in gpg 2.1.0, but that
version is as of now <a href="https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=gnupg2">only deployed
        in debian experimental</a>, not even sid. Another <a
            href="https://bugs.g10code.com/gnupg/issue1817">bug report</a> has been opened by jas
just today to backport the fix, so I hope this gets fixed soonish.</p>

<h2>A wrong primary user id is shown when searching on a Keyserver</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, this is a bug in the SKS Keyserver software. Its machine-readable output returns
the user ids in an arbitrary order. Read the <a
            href="https://bitbucket.org/skskeyserver/sks-keyserver/issue/28/primary-uid-in-machine-readable-index">related
        bug</a> report for more information.</p>
<h2>Not working with AOSP Mail</h2>

<p>For now, OpenKeychain will not support AOSP Mail due to bugs in AOSP were we cannot work around (<a
        href="https://github.com/open-keychain/open-keychain/issues/290">#290</a>).</p>
